------

The repository is constantly updated when **Python** or **SQL** solution to the problem found at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) and particularly [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) is solved. The solutions to **LeetCode** problems are posted at the discussion sections in each solved problem and the progress with additional information can be found by looking at my profile [there](https://leetcode.com/aurimas13/). 

The **HackerRank** solutions of **Python** are found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/HackerRank-LeetCode/tree/main/HackerRank/Python%20Solutions) while **LeetCode** solutions of **Python** are found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/HackerRank-LeetCode/tree/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions). Each problem folder has the description of the problem found through pressing the link in **README** at the respective folder. 

Currently, doing **Python** problems. **HackerRank Python** problems are finished and from *28th of May* am working on solving at least one **Python** problem from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) daily. The solution is put at the respective **LeetCode** folder. 

**SQL** solutions of problems at *HackerRank* & *LeetCode* will come in June while they are updated [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/HackerRank-LeetCode/tree/main/HackerRank/SQL%20Solutions) for **HackerRank** and [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/HackerRank-LeetCode/tree/main/LeetCode/SQL%20Solutions) for **LeetCode**.
